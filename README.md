# Unity project for "Relationship Between Motivational Strategies and Gamification User Types in VR Movement Games"

This is the official unity project used for the project "Relationship Between Motivational Strategies and Gamification User Types in VR Movement Games". View the paper here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10344250 

# How it works

This project is designed with potential applications such as stroke rehabilitation in mind. Each experience is personalised to a specific HEXAD user type (see more: https://www.gamified.uk/user-types/). 

It is recommended to undergo a HEXAD user type test before using the applications. This way you can pick the experiences which are most personalised to yourself. 


# Known Issues

The Philanthropist experience does not work correctly when running in a build. Objects will fall through the world occasionally. This can be fixed by running the experience in the unity editor.

Calibration is important, but some objects may still get very close to the user. It is best to keep this in mind when showing someone an experience.
